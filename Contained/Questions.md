**What is controller containment and what does it offer developers?**
Controller containment is when you embed one view controller within another.


**What is the difference between navigation and tab controllers? Under what circumstances do you use each one?**
A TabBarController is meant to define different modes/states of an application, where a NavigationController is to show hierarchal data.

You would want to use a TabBaController when you want to control different states of an application and a NavigationController to move through the application pages.


**Name at least one Apple-supplied iOS application that uses each container class and explain how they're used in each app.**
Apple News, Settings, Mail App, etc. These all use container classes. The Apple News app is uses the TabBarController for its Following, Today & News+ tabs to go between each other and uses a Navigation controller to swipe between articles.
